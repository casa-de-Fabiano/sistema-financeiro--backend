# Sistema Financeiro - Backend

Welcome to the backend repository of the **Sistema Financeiro** project! This repository contains the logic, validations, and essential functionalities for the backend of the application.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Language:** JavaScript
- **Database:** MySQL

#📚 Libraries and Frameworks
This project utilizes the following key libraries and frameworks:

Express: A web framework for building RESTful APIs and managing HTTP requests and middleware.

MySQL2: A library for interacting with MySQL databases, supporting promises and prepared statements.

JSON Web Token (jsonwebtoken): Used for creating and verifying JWTs, essential for secure authentication and authorization.

CORS: Middleware to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, allowing API access from different origins.

Dotenv: Loads environment variables from a .env file for secure configuration.

Multer: Handles multipart/form-data requests, useful for file uploads.

Development Tools
Nodemon: Automatically restarts the server during development when file changes are detected.

These tools and libraries form the backbone of the backend application, facilitating database interactions, secure authentication, efficient routing, and seamless development.
